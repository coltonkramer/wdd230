The site should have a common header, navigation, and footer.
üìÑ The Home page is a contemporary, exciting landing page providing
engaging images of the municipality,
local company advertisement section highlighting three local companies,
a call to action to join the chamber leading to a membership application, 
a description of the purpose of the chamber and its goals,
contact information,
social media links (at least two and it is OK if they are not linked to a real account),
an upcoming events area,
the current weather information, obtained from the One Call API at openweathermap.org (Links to an external site.). (Note that you must use this particular API and not the ones used with the weather site project) and include the following:
- the current temperature, current condition description, and humidity
- weather alerts if available (applicable) from the government and display it as a closeable message at the top of the page. (closeable means the user can click to remove the alert)
- display and label a three day forecast of the "day" temperature using the current date.

üìÑ The City (use the actual city name) page provides historical and current demographic information about the city. Use current imagery and include current city events.  Promote your city through any other creative method of content you determine would be effective.

üìÑ The Join page that contains information about the benefit of joining the chamber and a membership application form. The form should be well designed and use appropriate form elements and lead to a confirmation page that has the same basic design as the other pages. Collect the following information:
first name - required
last name - required
title
email - required
cell phone
business name - required
business address
business website
business description
membership level selection that displays the annual fees (only one option is allowed)
There are four options: Non-profit ($100), Bronze ($200), Silver ($400), Gold ($1000)
The different levels have different perks which you can explain on the page in a key. Things like directory listings, business trainings, social media posts, luncheon tickets, sponsorships with levels of advertising, etc.
 

üìÑ The Directory page provides a list of local business organizations that are actual, local businesses in your area. There should be at least 7 businesses listed. Include contact information, logos (if available), and actual web links (if available). The content build must be driven from a JSON data source of your own making. You can store this .json file in another üìÅfolder on your site. Display the directory as a grid of business 'cards'
Example buttons for grid and list view. For full credit consideration, this directory should have two buttons to display the cards either in a "grid view" (cards in multiple columns) or in a "list view" (a single column) for medium and larger views. This does not mean you need to change the layout structure, just the CSS when a button selection is made. The image provided here is just an example of what the buttons might look like in general.
üìÑ The Contact page will contain essential contact information for the chamber including (not necessarily in this order):
regular contact information
an embedded Google map (Links to an external site.) of the city
a basic Contact Us form asking for name, phone, and email with, of course, a comment.
a list of the board of directors
