📄 The City (use the actual city name) page provides historical and current demographic information about the city. Use current imagery and include current city events.  Promote your city through any other creative method of content you determine would be effective.

 

📄 The Directory page provides a list of local business organizations that are actual, local businesses in your area. There should be at least 7 businesses listed. Include contact information, logos (if available), and actual web links (if available). The content build must be driven from a JSON data source of your own making. You can store this .json file in another 📁folder on your site. Display the directory as a grid of business 'cards'
Example buttons for grid and list view. For full credit consideration, this directory should have two buttons to display the cards either in a "grid view" (cards in multiple columns) or in a "list view" (a single column) for medium and larger views. This does not mean you need to change the layout structure, just the CSS when a button selection is made. The image provided here is just an example of what the buttons might look like in general.
